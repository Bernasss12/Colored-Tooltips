# Colored-Tooltips
Changes minecraft tooltips' color to match your needs.

There are currently 2 options to change your two tooltip colors:
- It can be dynamically changed to match an item's rarity.
- You can set a fixed color.

You can change everything to your liking using the config screen. (more complex settings should be added in the future, maybe)
